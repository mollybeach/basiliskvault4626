# Basilisk Vault 4626

A Privacy-Preserving, Policy-Enforced ERC-4626 Yield Vault for Institutional DeFi on Rayls

## Overview

Basilisk Vault 4626 is an institutional-grade ERC-4626 vault deployed on the Rayls Public Chain that transforms natural-language investment policies into enforceable onchain constraints. The vault uses an AI-driven risk engine, Rayls Enygma private transactions, and Rayls onchain identity to deliver compliant, confidential, and automated yield strategies that meet institutional requirements.

Basilisk enables secure, private, and automated investment workflows for financial institutions seeking to access DeFi yield while adhering to regulatory constraints, risk exposure limits, and compliance mandates.

This project is designed for the Rayls Hackathon and fully aligns with Rayls' focus on privacy, institutional tokenised assets, real-time settlement, and EVM-compatible programmable infrastructure.

## Key Features

### 1. ERC-4626 Yield Vault

A standardised, composable tokenised vault that accepts deposits (USDr, RLS, or approved Rayls-chain assets) and issues proportional vault shares. Yield generated by the strategy increases the share value over time, enabling seamless integrations across Rayls-based DeFi protocols.

### 2. Natural-Language Investment Policies → Onchain Constraints

Institutions define their investment mandates in plain English:

- "At least 70 percent must be in USD-pegged assets."
- "No more than 10 percent exposure to unbacked crypto."
- "Daily Value-at-Risk must remain under 4 percent."

An AI engine converts these mandates into onchain constraints enforced by the vault's Policy Manager smart contract.

### 3. AI-Driven Risk Desk

A backend agent continuously monitors:

- Volatility levels
- Rayls-native oracle risk signals
- Asset exposures
- Liquidity and slippage indicators
- KYB/AML status of counterparties
- Stability of underlying assets

If the portfolio approaches a breach of its policy, the vault automatically rebalances.

### 4. Rayls Enygma Private Execution

All trading and rebalancing operations are executed privately using Rayls Enygma:

- Hidden asset weights
- Hidden trade sizes
- Encrypted state commitments
- Selective disclosure for regulators

Position secrecy is maintained while still providing regulators with verifiable audit proofs.

### 5. Onchain Identity Enforcement

The vault integrates Rayls' LayeredID and institutional KYB attestations:

- Only approved institutions may deposit
- Counterparty risk rules are automatically enforced
- Retail users may access vaulted yield if permitted by policy

### 6. Machine-Readable Compliance Proofs

After each rebalance cycle, Basilisk emits cryptographic attestations that certify:

- All investment policies remain satisfied
- No illicit counterparties involved
- Exposures bounded by the institution's risk envelope

Regulators or auditors can verify these proofs without accessing private portfolio details.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

- **BasiliskVault.sol**
  - ERC-4626-compliant vault implementation
  - Manages deposits, withdrawals, accounting, and share issuance.

- **PolicyManager.sol**
  - Stores AI-generated constraints and enforces them before rebalancing operations.

- **EnygmaExecutor.sol**
  - Wraps private Enygma execution calls for trades, swaps, vault rebalancing, and settlement.

- **RiskOracleAdapter.sol**
  - Interfaces with Rayls offchain-to-onchain risk feeds and institutional identity attestations.

### Backend Services

- **AI Policy Compiler**
  - Converts natural-language mandates into structured rule sets.

- **Risk Engine**
  - Periodically evaluates vault health, exposures, and constraints.

- **Private Trade Coordinator**
  - Coordinates Enygma encrypted transactions and provides proofs to onchain components.

### Frontend

A minimal dashboard enabling:

- Policy creation and editing
- Deposit and withdrawal flows
- Compliance status view
- Risk metrics
- Private trade logs (encrypted)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18

Explorer: https://devnet-explorer.rayls.com
Gas Token: USDgas
```

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<repo>/basilisk-vault-4626
cd basilisk-vault-4626
npm install

npx hardhat compile
```

### Deploy to Rayls Devnet

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rayls
```

## How Basilisk Generates Yield

1. Depositors lock assets into the ERC-4626 vault.
2. The vault allocates capital across Rayls-ecosystem yield sources:
   - RWAs
   - Lending markets
   - LP positions
   - Tokenised receivables
3. AI monitors strategy performance and risks.
4. Private rebalancing occurs via Enygma to maintain compliance.
5. Vault share value increases as yield accrues.

## Security Model

- Private transactions via Enygma prevent trade leakage or front-running.
- All depositors must be authenticated with Rayls LayeredID.
- PolicyManager ensures no trades can violate institutional mandates.
- Deterministic finality on Rayls prevents settlement risk during rebalancing.
- Optional offchain auditing via selective disclosure mechanisms.

## Roadmap

## Why Basilisk?

The basilisk is a mythological creature that moves unseen and strikes with precision. The Basilisk Vault embodies the same philosophy: silent, private, compliant, and highly efficient.

Institutions get the privacy they require, DeFi gets the liquidity it needs, and regulators gain transparency without sacrificing confidentiality.
